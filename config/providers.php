/**
 * Application Service Providers Configuration
 *
 * Register your application service providers here.
 * These providers are loaded AFTER framework and package providers.
 *
 * Loading Order:
 * 1. Framework providers (core framework services) - automatic
 * 2. Auto-discovered package providers (from packages/ and vendor/) - automatic
 * 3. Application providers (defined below) - your business logic
 *
 * Lazy Loading:
 * All providers support lazy loading. The register() method is called during bootstrap,
 * but expensive operations should be deferred to boot() method which is called only
 * when the service is actually needed.
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * - Keep providers focused (Single Responsibility)
 * - Use boot() for operations that depend on other services
 * - Group related bindings in the same provider
